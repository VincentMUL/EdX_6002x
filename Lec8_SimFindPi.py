# Monte Carlo method
# Coined in 1949 by Stanislaw Ulam and Nicholas Metropolis
# Ulam together with Edward Teller, John von Neumann, and others worked on the Manhattan Project
# Ulam and Teller designed the hydrogen bomb
# Monte Carlo method of Ulam was invented in 1946, when he was sick in bed
# He was playing solitaire in bed, convalescing from an illness
# The Question: What are the chances that a Canfield solitaire 
# laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully?
# He saw a link with neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics.
# He was able to transform processes described by differential equations into 
# an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations.
# Later described to John Von Neumann. Talked about computers like ENIAC 
# (+/- 1000 additions per second), today's computers about 1000000000 additions per second.
# The Monte Carlo method was used during Manhattan project!

# Monte Carlo method:
# Our roulette simulation was a classic Monte Carlo simulation.
# Method of estimating the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of inferential statistics.
# Uses a Population (set of examples) and a Sample (subset of examples).
# Key fact is the random sample is representative of the population.
# Amazingly, Monte Calro simulation and randomized algorithms in general can be used
# to solve problems that are inherently not stochastic.
# Example: simuation of pi - ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle.

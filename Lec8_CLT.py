# Why does the emperical rule work for normal distributions?
# Because we are reasoning not about a single 'spin',
# but about the average of many spins.
# And the central limit theorem applies.

# The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental theorem 
# in probability theory. Given a sufficiently large sample:
# 1. The means of the samples in a set of samples,
#    will be approximately normally distributed.
# 2. This normal distribution will have a mean close to the mean
#    of the population.
# 3. This variance of the sample means will be close to the variance
#    of the population divided by the sample size.

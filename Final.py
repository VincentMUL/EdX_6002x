# Problem 1

# Problem 1-1
# Consider deriving the probability of a coin flip coming up heads by running m trials of 100 flips each. 
# If the coin is fair, the mean probability of the m trials will go to 0.5 as m goes to infinity.
# True [X]

# Problem 1-2
# Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard deviation of B is 5. 
# For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a histogram with 10 bins, 
# creating one histogram for each distribution.
# The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B.
# The rightmost bin of B will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of A.
# The rightmost bin of A will have the same number of points as the rightmost bin of B.
# Any of the above are possible.
# Answer: Any of the above are possible. (I answered: The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B.)
# Why is the answer "Any of the above are possible."?

# Problem 1-3
# You roll an unfair (weighted) die. The distribution of the numbers rolled is a uniform distribution.
# False, because the distribution of the numbers rolled is not a uniform distribution.

# Problem 1-4
# A simulation
#   is useful when describing a system that cannot easily be described mathematically.
#   is easy to successively refine.
#   can be used to extract intermediate results.
#   All of the above
#   None of the above
# Answer: All of the above

# Problem 1-5
# The following image plots the population of the US over time, along with a model fit to the data. 
# The graph is of points linearly from 1900 to 2000 and a red line fitted to the points 
# that dips to 0 from x=2000 to x=2050
# overfitting

# Problem 1-6
# If the RÂ² of a model produced using linear regression is 0.7, 
# the model accounts for 70% of the variance in the observations.
# Answer: True

# Problem 1-7
# Given a finite set of data points there exists a polynomial fit such 
# that the polynomial curve goes through each point in the data.
# Answer: False, because the polynomial curve does not have to go through each point in the data.

# Problem 1-8
# You want to calculate confidence intervals by applying the empirical rule, 
# which requires that you have a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. 
# Which approach can you use to estimate the mean and standard deviation that you need? Choose all that work.
    # Central Limit Theorem, which requires that you have many sufficiently large samples from the population
    # Standard Error, which requires that you have one sufficiently large sample
# Answer: Both, because both the Central Limit Theorem and Standard Error can be used to estimate the mean and standard deviation that you need.
# Explanation: ?

# Problem 1-9
# You have a bucket with 4 red balls and 4 green balls. You draw 3 balls out of the bucket. 
# Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket, you don't replace it. 
# What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color? 
# Answer the question in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.
# Reasoning: 3/7*2/6 = 1/7

# Problem 8 part A:

# For this problem you are going to simulate growth of fox and rabbit population in a forest!
# The following facts are true about the fox and rabbit population:
    # The maximum population of rabbits is determined by the amount of vegetation in the forest, 
    # which is relatively stable.
    # There are never fewer than 10 rabbits; the maximum population of rabbits is 1000.
    # For each rabbit during each time step, a new rabbit will be born with a probability of pRabbitReproduction
    # pRabbitReproduction = 1.0 - currentPopulationOfRabbits/1000
    # In other words, when the current population is near the maximum, 
    # the probability of giving birth is very low, and when the current population is small, 
    # the probability of giving birth is very high.
    # The population of foxes is constrained by number of rabbits.
    # There are never fewer than 10 foxes.
    # At each time step, after the rabbits have finished reproducing, 
    # a fox will try to hunt a rabbit with success rate of pFoxEatRabbit
    # pFoxEatRabbit = currentPopulationOfRabbits/1000
    # In other words, the more rabbits, the more likely a fox will eat one.
    # If a fox succeeds in hunting, it will decrease the number of rabbits by 1 immediately. 
    # Remember that the population of rabbits is never lower than 10.
    # Additionally, if a fox succeeds in hunting, then it has a 1/3 probability of giving birth in the current time-step.
    # If a fox fails in hunting then it has a 10 percent chance of dying in the current time-step.
    # If the starting population is below 10 then you should do nothing. 
    # You should not increase the population nor set the population to 10. 
# Start with 500 rabbits and 30 foxes.
# At the end of each time step, record the number of foxes and rabbits.
# Run the simulation for 200 time steps, and then plot the population of rabbits 
# and the population of foxes as a function of time step.

# Test 4 did not work because I reset the fox population to something and I shouldn't do that, which is why
# the grader gave output 0 10. 
# 2 hints, first one is relevant here:
# "See Full Output": If you are getting the line "0 10" in your output for "Test 4 foxGrowth" then for this particular test, 
# your code changes the CURRENTFOXPOP (increases it if the fox population has gone below the minimum fox population), 
# which is not the right behavior -- the code should not reset CURRENTFOXPOP.

# It is not correct to assume that there is a 1/3 chance that the population increases in "Test 3 foxGrowth". 
# Pay special attention to the following statement in the docstring of foxGrowth(): 
# "Each fox, based on the probabilities in the problem statement, may eat one rabbit 
# (but only if there are more than 10 rabbits)."

# Problem 8 Part B:
# Follow the next steps of the simulation to answer the remaining questions.

# Step 4: Assume MAXRABBITPOP = 1000, CURRENTRABBITPOP = 500, CURRENTFOXPOP = 30, numSteps = 200. 
#         Plot two curves, one for the rabbit population and one for the fox population. 
#         You won't be submitting the plots. They are for your own understanding.

# Step 5: Use polyfit to find the coefficients of a 2nd degree polynomial for the rabbit curve 
#         and the same for the fox curve. 
#         Then use polyval to evaluation the 2nd degree polynomial and plot it, e.g.
#         coeff = polyfit(range(len(rabbitPopulationOverTime)), rabbitPopulationOverTime, 2)
#         plot(polyval(coeff, range(len(rabbitPopulationOverTime))))
# Of course your variables and plotting commands may not look identical to the above code; 
# the above code is shown just to give you an idea of what we mean.
# Once you have finished Steps 4 and 5, continue on to answer the following questions.

# Let's plot two curves, one for the rabbit population and one for the fox population.

# At some point in time, there are more foxes than rabbits.
# Answer: True

# Problem 8 -3:
# The polyfit curve for the rabbit population is:
# A concave up curve (looks like a U shape)

# Problem 8 -4:
# The polyfit curve for the fox population is:
# A concave down curve (looks like an upside down U shape)

# Problem 8 -5:
# Changing the initial conditions from 500 rabbits and 30 foxes to 50 rabbits and 300 foxes 
# changes the general shapes of both the polyfit curves for the rabbit population and fox population.
# Answer: False

# Problem 8 -6:
# Let's say we make a change in the original simulation. 
# That is, we are going to change one detail in the original simulation, 
# but everything else will remain the same as it was explained in Problem 8 - Part A.
# Now, if a fox fails in hunting, it has a 90 percent chance of dying 
# (instead of a 10 percent chance, as in the original simulation).
# Changing the probability of an unsuccessful fox dying from 10% to 90% changes the general shapes of both 
# the polyfit curves for the rabbit population and fox population.
# Answer: True, they switch places, Rabit U shape and Fox upside down U shape, with Rabit above Fox.
# Grader disagrees, perhaps they meant just the shape. As in U and upside down U, not the order of them.
